# Loyalty website
Task: Assuming you were asked to design and develop a loyalty platform that rewards customer whenever they make a transaction with a particular merchant. Customers can view all ongoing offers of a merchant. If a customer has transacted with a merchant before, the customer is automatically a follower of the merchant. Ongoing offers consist of stamps, points and unique vouchers.

## About this project:
1. This is my first project using VueJS Framework =D
2. I'm using fetch requests to load data whenever a customer lands on the page and integrating with existing REST APIs (my first time also xD)
3. This project has been done for less than 24 hours because I have a limited time constraint due to my final year project beta testing is next week x_x (pray for me!!)
